  <p id="kolli Hills">
  Kolli Hills or Kolli Malai is a small mountain range located in central Tamil Nadu and 
  spread over the Namakkal district and Tiruchirapalli district of India. 
  The mountains rise to 1300 m[1] in height and cover an area of approximately 280 km2. 
  It is situated at a distance of 43 km from Namakkal and 120 km from Trichy. 
  They are part of the Eastern Ghats, a mountain range that runs mostly parallel to 
  the east coast of southern India. Home to the Arapaleeswarar temple, the mountain is a 
  site of pilgrimage, but the area is also popular with motorcycle enthusiasts because of 
  the high-altitude motorable terrain with 70 hairpin bends.</p><br>

  <p id="Historical references">The Kolli Hills are featured in several works of classical Tamil literature such as 
    Silappathigaram, Manimekalai, Purananuru and Akananuru. Mahavidwan R. Raghava Iyengar 
    in the research monograph Araichi Katturaigal has given exhaustive references to Kollipavai 
    from early Sangam literature, concluding that the image is in Kolli Hills. 
    The region was ruled by Valvil Ori around 200 CE, who is praised as one of the seven great 
    philanthropists of ancient Tamil Nadu. His valor and marksmanship are sung by several poets,
     and his exploits are a popular part of folklore. Ori is said to have killed a lion, bear, 
     deer and a boar with a single arrow. The hills are said to be guarded by Kollipavai also called 
     as "Ettukkai Amman", the local deity. According to legend, the sages chose Kolli hills when 
     they were looking for a peaceful place to do their penance. However, the demons invaded the 
     hills to disrupt the penance when the sages began their rituals. The sages prayed to 
     Kollipavai, who according to the myth, chased away the demons with her enchanting smile. 
     The Kollipavai hills is still worshipped by the people here and her smile is revered. 
     The mountains have several mythological legends associated with them, and often come across 
     as an eerie place in contemporary tales due to the unexplored and less traveled terrain. 
     This mountain is full of herbs which retains health and vigour. E. D. Israel Oliver King of 
     MS Swaminathan Research Foundation has documented over 250 sacred forests in Kolli Hills in the year 2005.</p><br>

    Apart from its historical significance, the mountains are covered with Tropical Moist Mixed evergreen forests, but increasing areas of forests have been cleared for farming. Farm products of the mountain ranges include black pepper, jackfruit, banana, pineapple, Oranges, Tapioca, and other spices. Rice and other minor millets (Foxtail, Finger Millet and Little Millet) form the staple food of the tribal people who inhabit these mountains. The jackfruit grown on these mountains is well known for its taste and fragrance and is often soaked in wild honey that is also harvested from these mountains.

    The mountain is a site of pilgrimage, because of the Arapaleeswarar temple, which is believed to have a secret path to the Shiva temple in Rasipuram. This Shiva temple is said to have been built by Valvil Ori in the 1st or 2nd century when he ruled this area. "Arappaleeswara sathakam" is a poem which praises Lord Arappaleeswarar. It is believed that this temple existed during the Sangam period itself.

According to legend, the Shiva linga in the temple was found when a farmer was ploughing his land. It is said that the farmer accidentally hit the Shiva linga while ploughing, and that led blood to ooze out of the statue. The small wound is said to be visible on the Shiva linga even today.

There is also a temple for Ettukai Amman or Kolli Pavai which is one of the oldest in the town and the place itself derives its name
